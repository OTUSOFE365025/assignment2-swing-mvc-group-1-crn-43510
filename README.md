Example of an MVC design based on Swing. Answer questions 1 & 2 in this README file.

Question 1:

The Swing framework is a GUI widget toolkit for Java applications. It's purpose is to provide the common components of a graphical application so that programmer could quickly start dealing with the logic of the application instead of the lower level system detail. Overall, the goal is to simplify the GUI application development.

Question 2:

In the lecture, we are told that the model is not aware of the view in a MVC design pattern, because the controller is the class that connect both of them and handle transacrtion. However, in this example code, model functions like setFirstName() is aware of the VIew class, and produce and output that is dependent to the value in View.
